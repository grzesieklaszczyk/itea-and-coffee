      <div class="full-event__topic"><mark>&mdash; </mark>A presentation is not PowerPoint. You are the presentation</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content"><mark>Agata Piórkowska</mark> is a Resource Manager at SoftServe with 5 years of professional experience in talent acquisition within IT sector. Psychology graduate with strong interest in human relations and personal development. Travel enthusiast and a book-lover.
      She likes to challenge herself by giving presentations from time to time.</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content">Do you consider public speaking a challenge? Do you read guide books on “how to rock your next presentation” while the question “how to survive your next presentation” would be far more accurate? Mark Twain once said: 'There are two types of speakers
      - those that are nervous and those that are liars'. I would like to convince you that while you should take great care
      of preparing content and design, delivery – the third inseparable part of every presentation – is actually the most
      important one. This speech is also meant to show you a dialogue as a great way to deliver a presentation… without passing
      out.</div>

         Angular, React, Knockdown, Backbone &mdash; there is a great many JavaScript frameworks on the market theese days with vibrant communities. Most of them have roots in older browsers and therefore make the programmers use constructs that feel unnatural even to achieve simple tasks.
         VueJS is different. It does away with old and clunky Internet Explorer and makes use of JavaScript and ES6 engines that power the web Today thus allowing more effective ways of creating more maintainable applications.</div>
