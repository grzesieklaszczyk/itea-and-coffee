      <div class="full-event__topic-content">While working on a last project we started from good practices provided by React official documentation. We found them helpful, but soon it appeared they are not enough. Overtime code clearness dropped significantly. This was thanks to continuously growing project, a diverse team and javascript itself with it’s flexibility and constantly appearing new features - which we like do adapt. Together with the team, we introduced a number of good practices to improve overall code consistency and readability. They are subjective and I want to share them.</div>
